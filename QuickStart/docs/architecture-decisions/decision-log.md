| We will continue providing valuable documentation during the complete course of this project | 19/08/2021 | No documentation at all, some documentation | We want to describe how the solution is constructed, but also why. And we want to enable every developer to have a quick(er) onboarding experience and understanding of the sytem, (sub-)systems, frameworks and procedures that can be used. | [Documentation guidelines](../guidelines/docs-guidelines.md) | All |   |
