# QuickStart Documentation

This is the landing page of the QuickStart Documentation website. You can add specific links that are important to provide direct access.

> [!TIP]
> Try not to duplicate the links on the top of the page, unless it really makes sense.

To get started with the setup of this website, read the getting started document with the title [Using DocFx and Companion Tools](./general/getting-started/README.md).

## Style of this website

This documentation website is currently setup with the basics of the [DocFx Material](https://ovasquez.github.io/docfx-material/) style added with the Microsoft logo. The combination can be found in **/QuickStart/docfx/template**. In the template we also enabled diagram support through [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org).
