# DocFx Templates

In this folder there are 2 templates used by the DocFx setup in QuickStart:

* **website** - this is the template used for the website. It is the default template combined with the materials template with a few additions. You can use this to style your website to your needs.
* **pdf** - this is the templated used for the generated PDF. It is far more limited in what you can do compared to the website. Please review [the PDF generator documentation](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/docs/pdf.html) and [how to customize the template](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/docs/template.html) on using this.
