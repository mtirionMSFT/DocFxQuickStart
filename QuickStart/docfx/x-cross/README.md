# Cross reference

This folder just contains this readme (obviously) and a `toc.yml` to link various Table-of-Content files (toc.yml) together. The result of including this file in the `docfx.json` is that the trees are combined into one in the website.

If you don't want to combine it, remove *"docfx/x-cross/*.yml"* from the content section in `docfx.json`.
